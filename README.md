# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the project:
Use input statements to filter the data for users weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, I choose four cities in Mexico to create a travel itinerary. Finaly, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map, by using the Google Maps Directions API.
